# Simple Web Page Project

This is a very basic HTML & CSS project used for learning Git and GitHub workflows, including local editing, committing, pushing changes to a remote repository, and deploying with GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure
simple-web-page/ 
├── index.html # Main HTML page 
└── styles.css # CSS styles for the page

## Goal

In the learning activity, you will:

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3. Edit the `index.html` file:
   - Add your name to the **Contributors** list.
   - Add your preferred image underneath your name.
4. Commit your changes and push them to your fork on GitHub.
5. Verify that your changes appear on your GitHub repository.
6. Deploy the page to **GitHub Pages**.

## Viewing the Page Locally

You can open `index.html` in any modern web browser by double-clicking it or using the **Open with** option.

## Commands You May Need

Below are some useful Git commands for this activity (order may vary depending on your workflow):

```bash
# Clone your fork to your local machine
git clone <URL-of-your-fork>

# Check status of your repository
git status

# Stage changes
git add index.html

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Update greeting and add my name to contributors"

# Push changes to your fork
git push origin main
